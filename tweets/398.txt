When I was 4 my parents banned me from pizza for a month because when I went to a fancy restaurant, I had a screaming fit over eating string beans. When I finally finished them off, a guy sarcastically clapped so I ran around the entire place and clapped for myself at each table. https://t.co/DWwyMxUlFP
